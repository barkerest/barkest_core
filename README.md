# BarkestCore

The BarkestCore project gets a web application off to a quick start by building on the Rails 4 framework.

This project includes basic user management, group based authorization, and a number of helper methods.

Add the library to your project:
    gem 'barkest_core',     :git => "git@bitbucket.org:rtecoder/barkest_core.git"

Setup your project to use the library:
    rails generate barkest_core:install

This is an interactive generator that will ask you to fill in a number of details and will generate not only
files specific to BarkestCore, but also to a healthy Rails project in general.
